# Tic-Tac-Toe 

The objective of this project is to make a tic-tac-toe game that can be played with two players. The UI will be responsive and give feedback on where the players place there X's and O's.

The aim of this project is to learn and become more comfortable with using objects, constructors, factory functions, and methods. To achieve there should be as little global code as possible.
